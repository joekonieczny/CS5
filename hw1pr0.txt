Joe Konieczny, Prompt #2

    I disagree with this on the simple premise that models, while certainly flawed, are crucial to predicting future
events. As actions happen in real time, such as the creation of new data, Google's motto of simply forgoing models
and instead using supercomputers to process that information blindly is certainly compelling. However computers, artificial
intelligence, and even human beings can only make predictions and assumptions of the future by modeling based on previous data.
Dropping models could lead to more accurate predictions, but for example you wouldn't want a car that dealt with engine problems
in real time. Rather, you'd want one that uses modeling and real-time data to predict that you'll need an oil change soon.
