There absolutely have been times that I feel like my thought has been limited by my language.
I am an Arabic language minor, and I feel like many words express thoughts in Arabic that have no direct translation in English, such as insha'allah and alhamdulilah.
Many of these have a religious connotation but also represent important concepts that I cannot translate.
For example, insha'allah refers to a generic future that we have no tense, or way of expressing, in English.
I imagine that coding and programming feels similar limitations-- you must express ideas and concepts we understand in a more limited and structured language.
I don't know if artificial languages can shape human thought, but I think that artificial languages have potential to cross linguistic lines, as well as help model in simple terms complex grammatical functions.
One example of this that comes to mind are grammatical particles in Arabic, such as "hael."
Hael has no direct translation, and is used to edit the structure to the subsequent sentence, just like if and elif edit the logical flow of a block.
